A Network Packet Sniffer developed in Python 3. Packets are disassembled
as they arrive at a given network interface controller and their information
is displayed on the screen.

This application maintains no dependencies on third-party modules and can be
run by any Python 3.6+ interpreter.

## Demo
![demo](https://github.com/EONRaider/static/blob/02a36787c0c2253e26c0e934b7c57a54181ccd55/packet-sniffer/demo.gif)

## Running the Application
### I. Execute the binary
Download the Network Packet Sniffer from the dist directory and run it. 
Administrative privileges are required due to the use of `socket.SOCK_RAW` by the
decoder.
```shell
user@host:~$ sudo ./packet_sniffer
```

### II. (Optional) Build your own binary
What if you don't trust third-party binaries running with `sudo` on your system? In this 
case the `build.py` file can be used to compile your own binary.

Building the binary requires the `PyInstaller` package. You just need to install all dependencies and build. 
Dependency management works with both [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (recommended) and [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). 
```shell
user@host:~$ git clone https://github.com/EONRaider/Packet-Sniffer.git
user@host:~$ cd Packet-Sniffer
user@host:~/Packet-Sniffer$ poetry install <--or--> pip install -r requirements.txt
user@host:~/Packet-Sniffer$ python3 build.py
```

### III. (Optional) Development Mode
It's also possible to run the application *without any third-party dependencies or 
manipulation of binaries.* Simply clone this repository with `git clone` and execute 
the `packet_sniffer.py` file by passing the required `PYTHONPATH` to `sudo`.
```shell
user@host:~$ git clone https://github.com/EONRaider/Packet-Sniffer.git
user@host:~$ cd Packet-Sniffer
user@host:~/Packet-Sniffer$ sudo --preserve-env PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python3 src/packet_sniffer.py
```
*Why the black magic with `sudo`? The command is required due to the use of `socket.SOCK_RAW`. 
The `--preserve-env` option is required because the `src` module is only visible from the 
root directory of the project and, hence, `PYTHONPATH` must be manipulated accordingly. This 
is not a result of the design of the tool itself, but of the way Python works internally.*

## Usage
```
packet_sniffer.py [-h] [-i INTERFACE] [-d]

Network Packet Sniffer

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INTERFACE, --interface INTERFACE
                        Interface from which packets will be captured (monitors
                        all available interfaces by default).
  -d, --displaydata     Output packet data during capture.
```
